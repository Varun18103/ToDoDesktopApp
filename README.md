# To_Do_Desktop_App

The "To Do Desktop App" is a project developed using the Python programming language, Qt Designer for creating the user interface, SQLite for data storage, and PyCharm as the integrated development environment (IDE).

The goal of the project is to create a desktop application that allows users to manage their tasks and to-do lists efficiently. The application provides a user-friendly interface where users can add, edit, and delete tasks, set priorities and due dates, and mark tasks as completed.

The application's user interface is designed using Qt Designer, which allows for a visually appealing and intuitive layout. Qt Designer provides drag-and-drop functionality, making it easier to design the application's windows, buttons, labels, and other UI elements.

SQLite is used as the database system for storing and managing the tasks. It is a lightweight and self-contained database engine that integrates seamlessly with Python. The application utilizes SQLite to store task information, such as task name, description, priority, due date, and completion status.

PyCharm, a popular Python IDE, is used for coding, debugging, and testing the application. It provides a robust set of tools and features that enhance the development process, including code completion, debugging capabilities, and version control integration.

By combining Python, Qt Designer, SQLite, and PyCharm, the "To Do Desktop App" project aims to provide users with a convenient and efficient tool for organizing and managing their tasks on their desktop computers.
